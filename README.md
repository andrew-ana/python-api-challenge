# Weather and Vacation Spots with Python API Calls

### Interesting findings from Weather Data
1. The maximum temperatures found are actually slightly north of the equator. This is because during May, the northern hemisphere is actually closer to the sun
2. Cloudiness surprisingly isn't impacted by Latitude, I would have thought that it would correlate like temperature
3. Humidity correlates less than I would have expected.
